Sleep City was one of the few cities that had never seen war and terror, for long before its founding as the center for
learning in Germany under Victor Hugo’s rule. Cologne was the capital of a Kingdom named Bavaria; it’s one of the oldest
states on earth. With more than 45,000 people in 2008 and counting, this city had more tourists each year than Paris or
Venice, Germany is home to two countries. When you hear "Cologne" you’ll see many statues, frescoes, paintings all of
which were decorated with motifs, scenes of war; from battles fought and fallen heroes that never recovered. One night
at 7 PM a terrible horror story happened. Cologne was still a beautiful city but suddenly there appeared the ghost of
Koudougou on this very day. As time went by, things changed slowly. But one night during this unusual month in January
1821 the City Wall in Cologne and in other places, with their old churches and mosques all came into action. The Germans
fought not just to prevent it but for power that would eventually have to be replaced as part of the larger war.
On Christmas Day in February they began massacring civilians there on February 29, killing many children who didn’t
know any better or more likely to become part of the fighting. It wasn’t until after this catastrophe that Germans
realized just how ruthless it was, but with what was available the result would have been impossible and fatal.
So people came here; not only as a result of the violence, they also saw new wonders in their new country like Cologne,
German capital. On that same day another horror occurred on this beautiful city; 53 women from this family, called
Schmieser sisters died together. They had come for spring season with 370 people. On Christmas Eve, there were only
127 inhabitants, and all but one died that night; then the new year arrived and there was just enough light to start
over. These are some of the horrific scenes and horror tales which you can expect when traveling around this country
in Germany. The history of the cities, such as Cologne or the city Wall; the terrible deeds like these will forever
remain on their faces. This is where history will leave their footprints and scar them with new wounds to continue in
history. From Berlin to Dusseldorf there is so much of Europe that German people would have always considered their
home after 350 years, this was a country where power came to life from ancient times; but Germany’s history now looks
like it did for 60 years, as violence and death will become part of every year on January 29. This city can not be
removed because there is history there. From the ruins, German people look around with hatred. But that hatred would
have been transformed in order to form the strong and powerfull society in their new land, after these women from the
past became one for us. All the people of Germany, from young adults who went through their lives here until they leave
them. For a country which has 60 years history but still keeps this horrible history it would have become its future
because history can't be stopped like a war. Germany was no exception. There’s also something else you should know;
not all German cities will show on the world map or show in movies and tv shows, Germany has so much rich culture in
each of the city that we still need to protect it's rich culture for us all. After visiting Cologne I feel as if the
streets have a feeling which is never existed. It has new wonders from time immemorial with power at the front line;
but also from this past there comes with evil. After experiencing history, Germany is not afraid of evil people either.
That was one night in the city where there were more women killed, men too. Cologne or what the future is; that is one
question for Germans to face in every new life that came, now I'm gonna take my first trip here again with a strong
spirit on my back, hoping we can continue together after history has made a choice. Stay tuned for more!
