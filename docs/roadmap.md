# Roadmap

There is no official Roadmap for konterfAI yet. But here are some ideas that I have in mind:

- [X] Provide official docker images, so that konterfAI can be easily deployed.
- [ ] Create random permuted html-templates to make it harder for the crawlers to detect the poisoned content.
- [X] Output random html header information with each request.
- [X] Create groups of randomized meta keywords and meta descriptions to create aditional false context for the hallucinations.
- [ ] Provide official downloadable binary releases.
- [X] Telemetry I: Local telemetry to see how many requests are poisoned (probably a web dashboard on another port).
- [ ] Telemetry II: Global telemetry to see how many requests are poisoned worldwide (Opt-In of course).
