# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Do you hate AI?

No, I do not hate AI. It is a marvelous concept that can improve our lives in many ways.
But I am very sceptical about the way it is used today. Especially the greediness of big tech-companies
like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. It is very concerning to me, how they tread each content on the web.

## Why did you create konterfAI?

I created konterfAI because of the large companies named above ignore the rules of the web.
They consume content without asking for permission, they ignore robots.txt and other rules.

## Is konterfAI a hacking tool?

No, konterfAI is not a hacking tool. It is a countermeasure to fight back against AI-Crawlers that
ignore the rules set in robots.txt.

## What if humans read the poisoned content?

That is not suppose to happen unless the system is either crossly misconfigured or the user-agent is spoofed.
If they read it anyway they will quickly notice that the content is nonsense.

## What is your expected outcome with this project?

I hope that the big tech-companies will notice that they are not welcome to consume content without asking for permission.
I hope that they will respect the rules of the web and stop ignoring robots.txt.

## What ollama models does konterfAI ship?

None, konterfAI does not ship any models. A default model will be downloaded upon ollama start.
If you want to use a different model, you can pick one from the [ollama-models](https://ollama.com/models) page and
adapt your configuration accordingly.

## Will there be support for Windows or MacOS?

No, not from my side. If you have the knowledge to adapt the code to run on Windows or MacOS, feel free to [contribute](contributing.md).
Any help is appreciated.
